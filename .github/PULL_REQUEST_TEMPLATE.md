Thank you for contributing to Nokogiri! To help us prioritize, please take care to answer the questions below when you submit this pull request.


**What problem is this PR intended to solve?**

If there is an existing issue that describes this, feel free to simply link to that issue.

Otherwise, please provide enough context for the Nokogiri maintainers to understand your intent.


**Have you included adequate test coverage?**

We have a thorough test suite that allows us to create releases confidently and prevent accidental regressions. Any proposed change in behavior __must__ be accompanied by tests.

If possible, please try to write the tests so that they communicate intent.


**Does this change affect the C or the Java implementations?**

If you're proposing a change to the C implementation, has the behavior change been made to the Java code as well? And vice versa?

If not, that may be OK, just please note it here.
